                        As a developer, I see coding not just as a profession but as a vocation, a way to serve
                        God and humanity through the art of software creation. My faith is the cornerstone of my work.
                        Though I believe AI cannot create with true purpose, I utilize it as a powerful tool to enhance my work.
                        And so, I strive to infuse every project with integrity, compassion, and a commitment to excellence.

                        In this digital cathedral, I invite you to explore not just my technical skills but also the principles
                        that guide my journey as a developer. Here, faith and code intertwine, creating a space where innovation
                        is driven by purpose, and technology serves the greater good.

                    <p>
                        All my life, I have been well-enveloped in technology.
                        From a young age, I was captivated by the inner workings of computers, leading me to pursue
                        formal education and certifications in the field. I hold a CompTIA A+ certification, which
                        attests to my foundational knowledge in computer hardware and software.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My programming journey began with gLua for a game called Garry's Mod, where my curiosity
                        about game mechanics and modding sparked a deeper interest in coding. There is where my passion
                        for programming truly took root. Since then, I have expanded my skill set to include languages
                        such as C++, Java, C#, SQL, Node.Js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                        I am also proficient in AI prompting, leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance my development process.
